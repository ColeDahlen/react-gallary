# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

This project allows you to press on a picture and the description of that picture will appear instead of the picture, and has a working like button. 

I used a get route to render the pictures onto the dom. I then used conditonal rendering in a loop (.map) to display either a description or a picture. This was determined by a boolean on client side, and this was changed with a dynamic state. I also created a like button that would change data in the server and then render it back on the dom, using a put route.
